- Snapshotting locally for pruning and truncating historical data. Also allows fast joins without needing to download the full state.

- Auto upgrades for state upgrades without hard forks (like the hub_2 upgrade)

- Support for gateway assets from gateway configured downstream chains (like private chain hubs)

- IBC assets (generated from other Cosmos hubs)
